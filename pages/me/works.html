  Salesforce API to Google Sheet Data Integration
</h3>
<small>Aug 2023 - Present</small>

<p>
  This sample project not only showcases my expertise in implementing Salesforce API integration with Google Sheets using ASP.NET and C# but also addresses two significant challenges encountered during development. 
  It serves as a powerful demonstration of my skills and capabilities in overcoming these obstacles in data integration and software development.
</p>


<h4>Project Implementation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1. Salesforce API Connectivity and Data Retrieval:</strong>
    <p>Despite Salesforce's API limitation of retrieving only 2000 records per request without built-in paging, I've developed a robust solution to ensure complete data retrieval.
      To enhance speed and efficiency, I've incorporated parallel task execution to send a high volume of requests in parallel, optimizing data extraction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2. Data Transformation:</strong>
    <p>I showcase my ability to efficiently transform the retrieved data into a format compatible with Google Sheets, ensuring a seamless integration.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>3. Google Sheets Integration:</strong>
    <p>Using ASP.NET and C#, I seamlessly integrate the Salesforce report data into Google Sheets, providing a user-friendly and collaborative platform for data analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>4. Code Efficiency and Best Practices:</strong>
    <p>The project adheres to coding best practices, emphasizing my ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code, especially crucial in a high-demand, parallel-processing environment.</p>
