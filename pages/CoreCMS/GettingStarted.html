Getting Started with CoreCMS

Welcome to CoreCMS, an ASP.NET Core Content Management System built with a focus on Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start using CoreCMS for your content management needs.
Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

    .NET Core SDK (version X.X or later)
    Visual Studio or any code editor of your choice

Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up CoreCMS:

    Clone the CoreCMS repository from GitHub by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoreCMS.git

Open the project in your preferred code editor.

Restore the required NuGet packages by running the following command in the project's root folder:

dotnet restore

Next, create the database required for CoreCMS. Open the appsettings.json file and update the database connection string with your preferred database provider and connection details.

Apply the necessary database migrations by running the following command:

sql

dotnet ef database update

Once the migrations are applied successfully, build the solution by running:

dotnet build

Finally, start the CoreCMS application by running the following command:

arduino

    dotnet run

Congratulations! CoreCMS is now up and running on your local machine.
Accessing the Admin Panel

To access the CoreCMS admin panel and start managing your content, follow these steps:

    Open your preferred web browser.

    Enter the following URL in the address bar:

    bash

    http://localhost:5000/admin

    You will be redirected to the login page. Use the default administrator credentials to log in:
        Username: admin
        Password: password

    Note: It is recommended to change the default administrator credentials for security purposes.

    Once logged in, you will have access to the CoreCMS admin panel, where you can create, edit, and manage your website's content.

    Develop custom modules: Build additional modules or functionality that integrate seamlessly with CoreCMS, such as integrations with third-party services or custom workflows.
    Customize themes: Modify the existing themes or create new ones to match your website's branding and design.
